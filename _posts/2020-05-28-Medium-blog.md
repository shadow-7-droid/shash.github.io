I came across this question, like every beginner in Mathematics does. It was to figure out whether irrationals raised to irrationals always result in an irrational number.

# The proof:

Consider the number $$ {\sqrt(2)}^{\sqrt(2)} $$.

If it is rational, we conclude that irrationals raised to irrationals may be rational.

Else, assume (√2)^(√2) is irrational.

Now consider the number ((√2)^(√2))^(√2). This is equal to (√2)², which is equal to 2, which is a rational.

Since the two cases were mutually exclusive and exhaustive, essentially we’ve established that irrationals raised to irrationals may result in rationals.

# The Beauty

The beauty of the proof lies in two things:
1. Without having any knowledge of the actual numbers, we established a proof.
2. The simplicity with which such a great thing was proved.
